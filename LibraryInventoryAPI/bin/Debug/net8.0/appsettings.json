        What does the above line mean? Let's break it down:
        Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB  This means connect to SQL Server LocalDB, a local, developer-friendly version of SQL Server.
        Database=LibraryDB              This means your database will be called LibraryDB.
        Trusted_Connection=True         This means it uses Windows Authentication instead of requiring a username/password.

        Now, if you go to Program.cs, there will be a line of code where we will tell the code to use DefaultConnection for the db details.
